	abstract = {Hospital Readmission is considered as an effective measurement of service and care provided within the hospital. Emergency readmission to hospital is frequently used as a measure of the quality of a hospital because a high proportion of readmissions should be preventable if the preceding care is adequate. The objective of this study to develop a model to predict 30-day hospital readmission. We have data of 1-lac diabetes patients with 50 features. We used machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost and XGBoost for prediction. We achieved the highest accuracy 94\% using Random forest among all other algorithms. The results from this study are encouraging and can help healthcare providers to improve their services.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a major chronic health problem affecting millions globally. Effective diabetes management can reduce the risk of hospital readmission and the associated financial losses for both the healthcare system and insurance companies. Hospital readmission is a high-priority healthcare quality measure that reflects the inadequacies in the healthcare system that also increase healthcare costs and negatively influence hospitals’ reputation. Predicting readmissions in the early stages prompts great attention to patients with a high risk of readmission. There has been some attempt in applying machine learning predictive models such as ensemble learning with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to correctly identify if the readmission can happen within 30 days ({\textless} 30 days) or it may never happen or happens after 30 days ( {\textbackslash}ge 30 days). We are proposing a new method that is applied to ANN to guide it through its gradient descent optimizers by realizing consistent vs inconsistent data in every batch. Our results show that there are up to 1.5\% improvement in classification accuracies in both 2-class and 3-class variations of the experimented benchmark dataset when using the guided optimizer to train the ANN as opposed to the standard optimizer. Guided ANN is also able to achieve better error convergence than standard ANN.},

	abstract = {Hospital readmission is considered a key metric in order to assess health center performances. Indeed, readmissions involve different consequences such as the patient's health condition, hospital operational efficiency but also cost burden from a wider perspective. Prediction of 30-day readmission for diabetes patients is therefore of prime importance. The existing models are characterized by their limited prediction power, generalizability and pre-processing. For instance, the benchmarked LACE (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Charlson comorbidity index and Emergency visits) index traded prediction performance against ease of use for the end user. As such, this study propose a comprehensive pre-processing framework in order to improve the model's performance while exploring and selecting a prominent feature for 30-day unplanned readmission among diabetes patients. In order to deal with readmission prediction, this study will also propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model on data collected from 130 US hospitals. More specifically, the pre-processing technique includes comprehensive data cleaning, data reduction, and transformation. Random Forest algorithm for feature selection and SMOTE algorithm for data balancing are some example of methods used in the proposed pre-processing framework. The proposed combination of data engineering and MLP abilities was found to outperform existing research when implemented and tested on health center data. The performance of the designed model was found, in this regard, particularly balanced across different metrics of interest with accuracy and Area under the Curve (AUC) of 95\% and close to the optimal recall of 99\%.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a chronic illness that affects around 425 million people globally in 2017, and this is predicted to increase to 629 million by the end of 2045. The ability to analyze and predict the readmission patterns of diabetic patients would allow the optimization of hospital resources and assessment of treatment effectiveness. This paper proposes an ensemble model to predict hospital readmission by choosing from a pool of 15 models, made up of variants of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (DT), Neural Network (NN) and Augmented Naïve Bayes (NB) networks. The final ensemble model was assembled using the five best models, determined based on individual model accuracy and the Jaccard distance between them, to maximize overall accuracy and sensitivity. The final ensemble contained DT (CHAID), Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes network, DT (CHAID with boosting), Neural Network with bagging and DT (CART with boosting). Compared against existing predictive models, the proposed ensemble was able to achieve improved sensitivity at 56\% while maintaining comparable accuracy at 63.5\%. Cluster analysis after performing principal component analysis on the dataset revealed 4 distinct clusters of patients. Patients with a history of in-patient visits or if they received a high amount of treatment in their current visit were found more likely to be readmitted.},

Predicting readmissions and long hospital stays in early stages allows extensive attention to patients identified with higher risks which leverages the community's healthcare and saves healthcare expenses and resources. This paper aims to investigate the predictive factors and develop a robust risk prediction framework, by combining feature engineering and machine learning algorithms. An actual data set has been used with various levels of routinely collected data that includes demographics, admission information, diagnosis, medications, tests, and service utilization information. The accuracy of our model using the readmission prediction achieved 94.8\% with random forests. The support vector machine (SVM) gives the highest area under curve (AUC) statistic (i.e. 0.97) in readmission prediction, and it stands out as an efficient algorithm in predicting length of stay with prediction accuracy of 78.5\%. Finally, analysis of features can be used to determine at-risk patients and target the delivery of early resource-intensive interventions.},

	abstract = {Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients has a significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. However, there are few national assessments of diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as a baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database (74 million unique encounters corresponding to 17 million unique patients) was undertaken to provide such an assessment and to find future directions which might lead to improvements in patient safety. Almost 70,000 inpatient diabetes encounters were identified with sufficient detail for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to fit the relationship between the measurement of HbA1c and early readmission while controlling for covariates such as demographics, severity and type of the disease, and type of admission. Results show that the measurement of HbA1c was performed infrequently (18.4\%) in the inpatient setting. The statistical model suggests that the relationship between the probability of readmission and the HbA1c measurement depends on the primary diagnosis. The data suggest further that the greater attention to diabetes reflected in HbA1c determination may improve patient outcomes and lower cost of inpatient care.},
